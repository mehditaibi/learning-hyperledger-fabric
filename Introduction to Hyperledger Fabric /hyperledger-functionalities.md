# Hyperldeger Fabric Functionalities 

Hyperledger Fabric is an implementation of distributed ledger technology that delivers enterprise-ready
network security, scalability, confidentiality and performance, in a modular blockchain architecture. 
Hyerledger Fabric delivers the following blockchain network functinalities: 

* Identity Management 
* Privacy and Confidentiality
* Efficient Processing. 
* Chaincode Functionality 
* Modular Design 

## Identity Management 

Hyperledger Fabric provides a membership identiy service that manages user IDs that authenticates all participants on the network.

Moreover, Access control lists can also be used to provide addtional layers of persmissions though the authorization of specic network operations. For example: 

I can of Academic exams over the Hyperlegder, only the Universities/ Educational institutions have the permissions to create new smart contracts for exams over the network. On the other hand, the students have the read of invocation persmissions over the network where they can take the exam or see the results. 

## Privacy and Confidentiality 
 
Hyperledger Fabric enables competing business interests, and any groups that require private, confidential 
transactions to coexist on the same permissioned network.

Hyperledger allows the creation of private channels that provide transaction privacy and confidentiality for specific subsets of netwok members. 

All the data over the Hyperledger network can be made inaccessible unless the proper permissions are provided to the network participant.

## Efficient Processing 

Hyperledger Fabric provides concurrency and parallelism to the network by separating transaction execution from transaction ordering and transaction commitment. 

This concurrent execution increases processing efficiency on each peer and accelerates delivery of 
transactions to the ordering service. 

Besides enabling parallel processing the separation of transactions unburdens ordering nodes from the demands of transaction execution and ledger maintenance, while peer nodes are freed from consensus workloads. 

## Chaincode Functionality 

Chaincode applications encode logic that is invoked by specific types of transactions on the channel.

Chaincode used for a change of asset onershup ensures that all transactions taht transfer ownership are under the same rules and requirements. 

Hyperledger also has the system chaincode that defines operating parameters for the entire channel.

## Modular Design

Hyperledger implements a modular architecture in the form of pluggable components. 

You can plugin specific algorithms for identity, ordering (consensus) and encryption into any Hyperledger Fabric network. 

The resultant netwrok is a universal blockchain architecture that can be adopted, across different markets, regulatory and geographic boundaries.
